# React.js Signup/Login page 

This project is a simple React application that features a registration and login form. The main component, App, renders a container with the Form component inside it. The Form component dynamically adjusts its content based on the value of the isRegistered prop passed to it. If the user is registered (isRegistered is true), the form displays fields for username and password along with a "Login" button. If the user is not registered (isRegistered is false), an additional password confirmation field is shown, and the button text changes to "Register."
